#![allow(rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links)]
//! The `driver` module is responsible for module resolution and dependency management.
//!
//! Our compiler operates in a strict pipeline: `Lexer -> Parser -> Driver -> AST`.
//! While the Parser only understands a single file at a time, the Driver processes
//! multiple files, resolves their dependencies, and converts them into a unified
//! structure ready for final AST construction.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ## Dependency Graph & Linearization
//!
//! The driver parses the root file and recursively discovers all imported modules
//! to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the project's dependencies. Because
//! the final AST requires a flat array of items, the driver applies a deterministic
//! linearization strategy to this DAG. This safely flattens the multi-file project
//! into a single, logically ordered sequence.
//!
//! ## Project Structure & Entry Point
//!
//! SimplicityHL programs begin execution at a single entry point file,
//! which the driver registers internally as the root [`MAIN_MODULE`].
//! This is typically the file passed as the root to the [`DependencyGraph::build_program`] function.
//!
//! External libraries are explicitly linked using the `--dep` flag. The driver
//! resolves and parses these external files relative to the entry point during
//! the dependency graph construction.
